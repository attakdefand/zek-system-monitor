# Implemented Features

This document provides a detailed overview of the features that have been implemented in Zek, particularly focusing on the high-priority items from the roadmap.

## ‚úÖ Completed High-Priority Features

### 1. Network Throughput Monitoring
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fully implemented and working
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `rx_throughput` and `tx_throughput` fields to `NetworkInfo` struct
  - Implemented `with_throughput` method to calculate throughput based on previous snapshots
  - Modified supervisor to store previous snapshots for delta calculations
  - Updated TUI to display throughput data in network table
- **Data Displayed**: 
  - RX/TX bytes (total)
  - RX/TX throughput (real-time speed in B/s, KiB/s, MiB/s, etc.)

### 2. Per-Core CPU Usage
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fully implemented and working
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `cpu_per_core: Vec<f32>` field to `Snapshot` struct
  - Collect per-core CPU usage using `sys.cpus()` from sysinfo crate
  - Updated TUI to display per-core CPU usage in a dedicated section
- **Data Displayed**:
  - Individual CPU core usage percentages
  - Visual representation of all cores

### 3. Swap Memory Monitoring
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fully implemented and working
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `swap_used_bytes` and `swap_total_bytes` fields to `Snapshot` struct
  - Collect swap memory information using `sys.total_swap()` and `sys.free_swap()` from sysinfo crate
  - Updated TUI memory gauge to show both RAM and swap usage
- **Data Displayed**:
  - Swap usage in GiB format
  - Swap usage percentage

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented Features

### 4. Disk I/O Statistics
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Not implemented due to sysinfo crate limitations
- **Reason**: The sysinfo crate version 0.30 does not provide direct access to disk I/O statistics (read/write operations per second, I/O queue depth, etc.)
- **Current Implementation**: 
  - Basic disk usage statistics (total, used, available space) are implemented
  - File system type and mount point information are displayed
- **Future Enhancement**: 
  - Would require platform-specific APIs or additional crates like `windows-sys` for Windows
  - Alternative approach could use performance counters or WMI on Windows

## üìä Summary of Data Collection

### Network Monitoring
- Interface name
- RX/TX bytes (total)
- RX/TX packets
- RX/TX errors
- RX/TX throughput (calculated in real-time)

### CPU Monitoring
- Overall CPU usage percentage
- Per-core CPU usage percentages
- System load averages (1, 5, 15 minutes)

### Memory Monitoring
- RAM usage (used/total)
- Swap memory usage (used/total)

### Disk Monitoring
- Mount point
- Total space
- Used space
- Available space
- Usage percentage
- File system type

### Process Monitoring
- Process ID (PID)
- Process name
- CPU usage percentage
- Memory usage

## üéØ Technical Implementation Details

### Data Collection Approach
1. **Snapshot-based collection**: System metrics are collected at regular intervals and stored as snapshots
2. **Delta calculations**: Throughput and rate metrics are calculated by comparing current and previous snapshots
3. **Real-time updates**: TUI refreshes at regular intervals to display the latest data

### Performance Considerations
- Minimal system resource usage
- Efficient data collection using sysinfo crate
- Fast UI updates using ratatui library

### Cross-platform Support
- Currently focused on Windows support
- Architecture designed to be extensible to Linux/macOS

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Short-term Goals
1. Implement disk I/O statistics using platform-specific APIs
2. Add temperature and sensor monitoring
3. Implement GPU utilization monitoring

### Long-term Goals
1. Web-based dashboard
2. Alerting system
3. Historical data retention
4. Plugin system for extensibility

## üìà Current Performance

The implemented features provide a comprehensive system monitoring solution with:
- Real-time network throughput monitoring
- Detailed CPU usage breakdown
- Complete memory monitoring including swap
- Disk usage statistics
- Process monitoring with top processes

All features are working correctly and provide valuable system insights similar to tools like Glances.
