# Features Completion Summary

This document summarizes the completion status of the features requested from FEATURE_ROADMAP.md lines 14-17.

## Requested Features (Lines 14-17 from FEATURE_ROADMAP.md)

### 1. ✅ Network Throughput Monitoring
**Status**: COMPLETELY IMPLEMENTED

**Implementation Details**:
- Added `rx_throughput` and `tx_throughput` fields to `NetworkInfo` struct
- Implemented `with_throughput` method to calculate real-time throughput
- Modified supervisor to track previous snapshots for delta calculations
- Updated TUI to display throughput data in network table

**Data Displayed**:
- Real-time network throughput in B/s, KiB/s, MiB/s formats
- Example: "Ethernet - 10.4 KiB/s RX, 3.6 KiB/s TX"

### 2. ⚠️ Disk I/O Statistics
**Status**: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**Implementation Details**:
- Basic disk usage statistics are implemented and working
- Disk I/O statistics (read/write operations per second, I/O queue depth, latency) are NOT available in sysinfo crate version 0.30
- Would require platform-specific APIs or additional crates for full implementation

**Currently Available**:
- Disk usage per mount point (total, used, available space)
- File system type information
- Usage percentage calculations

**Limitation**:
- sysinfo crate 0.30 does not provide disk I/O statistics
- Full implementation would require additional platform-specific code

### 3. ✅ Per-Core CPU Usage
**Status**: COMPLETELY IMPLEMENTED

**Implementation Details**:
- Added `cpu_per_core: Vec<f32>` field to `Snapshot` struct
- Collect per-core CPU usage using `sys.cpus()` from sysinfo crate
- Updated TUI to display per-core CPU usage in dedicated section

**Data Displayed**:
- Individual CPU core usage percentages
- Visual representation of all cores

### 4. ✅ Swap Memory Monitoring
**Status**: COMPLETELY IMPLEMENTED

**Implementation Details**:
- Added `swap_used_bytes` and `swap_total_bytes` fields to `Snapshot` struct
- Collect swap memory information using `sys.total_swap()` and `sys.free_swap()` from sysinfo crate
- Updated TUI memory gauge to show both RAM and swap usage

**Data Displayed**:
- Swap usage in GiB format
- Swap usage percentage in memory gauge

## Summary

Of the four requested features from FEATURE_ROADMAP.md lines 14-17:

- **3 features completely implemented**: Network throughput monitoring, Per-core CPU usage, Swap memory monitoring
- **1 feature partially implemented**: Disk I/O statistics (basic disk usage available, but I/O stats not available in current sysinfo version)

## Technical Notes

The implementation leverages the sysinfo crate version 0.30 capabilities. For features that require system-level metrics not available in this crate (like disk I/O statistics), a different approach would be needed, such as:

1. Using platform-specific APIs (Windows Performance Counters, Linux /proc filesystem)
2. Integrating additional crates that provide these metrics
3. Implementing custom collectors for specific operating systems

## Verification

All implemented features have been tested and verified to be working correctly:
- Network throughput shows real-time data transfer rates
- Per-core CPU usage displays individual core percentages
- Swap memory monitoring shows both RAM and swap usage
- Basic disk usage statistics are displayed correctly

The application provides a comprehensive system monitoring solution similar to tools like Glances.
