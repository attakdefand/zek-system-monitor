## UI Sections Displayed

The Zek system monitor displays information in the following sections:

1. **Title Bar** - "ZEK SYSTEM MONITOR"
2. **CPU Usage** - Overall CPU usage percentage with color-coded gauge
3. **Memory & Swap** - RAM and swap usage with detailed statistics
4. **System Load** - Load averages (1, 5, and 15 minutes)
5. **Network Summary** - Aggregate network statistics with real-time throughput
6. **Per-Core CPU Usage** - Usage percentage for each CPU core
7. **Network Interfaces** - Detailed statistics for each network interface
8. **Disk Usage** - Mount point usage statistics with color-coded usage percentages
9. **System Sensors** - Component temperatures and sensor data
10. **GPU Usage** - Graphics processing unit statistics (framework ready)
11. **Containers** - Docker/container monitoring (framework ready)
12. **Top Processes** - Top processes by CPU/Memory usage
13. **Footer** - Navigation instructions

All features marked as completed in the FEATURE_ROADMAP.md are displayed in the Zek system monitor, with UI frameworks in place for platform-specific implementations where needed.
